# AES-Encrypt-Decrypt 🔐
> 🔐A Secure file encryption/decryption CLI tool using AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2, and a random salt.

---

## 💡 About This Project
This is a command-line utility for secure file encryption and decryption. This project demonstrates how to properly implement modern, applied cryptography in Python, using industry-standard practices to protect against common attacks and ensure both **confidentiality** and **data integrity**.

---

## ✨ Key Features
* **🔒 AES-256-GCM Mode:** GCM stands for **Galois/Counter Mode**. It is a modern, high-performance mode of operation for AES that provides **Authenticated Encryption (AEAD)**. This means it delivers two critical security guarantees at once:
    * **Confidentiality:** It encrypts the data so no one can read it.
    * **Authenticity & Integrity:** It creates a special **authentication tag** (a MAC). During decryption, if the key is wrong *or* if the data has been tamtpered with (even by one bit), this check will fail and the script will stop. This prevents the user from accidentally decrypting a corrupted or malicious file.

* **🔑 Strong Key Derivation (PBKDF2):** Never uses the password directly as the key. It uses PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with 100,000 iterations to "stretch" the password into a robust 256-bit cryptographic key.

* **🧂 Random Salt:** A unique, 16-byte salt is generated for every encryption. This protects against rainbow table attacks and ensures that encrypting the same file with the same password will result in a different ciphertext every time.

* **🤫 Secure Password Entry:** Uses the `getpass` module to securely prompt for a password, so it isn't shown on the screen or stored in your shell history.

* **🖥️ User-Friendly CLI:** Built with `argparse` to provide clear `encrypt` and `decrypt` sub-commands.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **🐍 Python 3**
* **🛡️ `pycryptodome`:** The core library for cryptographic operations (AES, PBKDF2).
* **⌨️ `argparse`:** For building the command-line interface.
* **🤫 `getpass`:** For secure password input.

## 📸 Demo
Here is a step-by-step example of the script in action.

### 1. The Original File (`message.txt`)
First, we start with a simple text file containing a secret message.

---
### 2. Running the Encrypt Command
Next, we run the `encrypt` command in the terminal. It securely prompts for a password (which is hidden as you type).

Example the Password  i have used is Ciyah123


---
### 3. The Encrypted File (`encrypted.bin`)
The script produces a `.bin` file. The data is now unreadable, authenticated ciphertext.

---
### 4. Running the Decrypt Command
We run the `decrypt` command, using the same password.

---
### 5. The Final Decrypted File (`decrypted.txt`)
The script successfully decrypts the file, and the content is identical to the original.

---
### 6. Security Check (Failed Decryption)
Here is what happens if you use the **wrong password**. The script instantly fails and protects the data, proving the authentication is working.
